# commit-art

A completely useless project that creates art via github commit messages. 

## NOTE:

There is no code here yet - the above commits were done manually as a proof of concept. Coming soon!

## Idea

This project aims to pretty up your github repo with a commit per file.  Each commit message gets 80 chars for its header.  This project aims to use this as a 80 column by N-files display to render ascii based text / images.

## Warning

Once this works, it will probably mess up your commit count.

## Issues

1. How to deal w/ folders?
2. How to commit files w/out changing them (need to change their sha-hash) 
	-> We can require the user to change the file and leave them in a checked-out state.
